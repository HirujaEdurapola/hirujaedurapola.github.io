  <h2 class="sj-blog-h2">♟️ My Journey as a Chess Player</h2>

  <p class="sj-blog-p">
    Chess became part of my life thanks to my father. We played almost every weekend, and those simple games were the start of everything. In 2016, when I was in Grade 1, I officially joined the school chess club. The coach did a great job building the foundation I still use today.
  </p>

  <p class="sj-blog-p">
    I stopped for a few years and then restarted around 2023–2024 with much more maturity and understanding. Returning to chess felt natural, and I slowly rebuilt my passion for the game.
  </p>

  <h3 class="sj-blog-h3">My Play Style</h3>
  <p class="sj-blog-p">
    According to ChessPersonality.com, I am a <strong>Technician</strong> — more calculation than intuition, more positional than attacking, calm rather than emotional, and studious rather than playful. I like control and clarity. My main weakness is still the middlegame, especially converting advantages.
  </p>

  <h3 class="sj-blog-h3">Ratings & Achievements</h3>
  <p class="sj-blog-p">
    My estimated Elo according to ChessMonitor is <strong>1498</strong>.
    I’ve had several notable tournament performances over the years, including:
  </p>

  <ul class="sj-blog-ul sj-blog-p">
    <li>9th place in the All-Island Tournament (2021)</li>
    <li>Kalutara District — <strong>1st Place</strong> (2025)</li>
    <li>Multiple podium finishes in school sports meets</li>
    <li>Several merits in inter-school tournaments</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="sj-blog-h3">How I Train</h3>
  <p class="sj-blog-p">
    Nothing too complicated — I play, analyze, and improve. I regularly watch chess YouTubers like GothamChess and Igor, and also my club/coach’s channel: Golden Kings Chess Coaching Academy.
  </p>

  <h3 class="sj-blog-h3">What Chess Means to Me</h3>
  <p class="sj-blog-p">
    I don’t have long-term chess goals right now. I simply enjoy playing, learning, and competing. Maybe someday I’ll chase a rating formally — but for now, I just love the game.
